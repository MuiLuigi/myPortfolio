        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Fahad Arif - A student at Humber College and an aspiring Web Developer</p>

            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a student at Humber College, learning about web programming and javescript. My interests is gaming, reading, coding, and occasionally writing.</p>

            <p>In my journey so far, I have learned and gained experience and knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to apply them when coding. I continue to work on increasing my knowledge by working on personal projects or exercises to improve my skills and gain more experience.</p>
        <p>
            As I continue to grow, I will keep applying everything I learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will practice by doing exercises and use my knowledge, skills, and experience on bigger projects. Please feel free to explore my work.
        </p>

                <h3>Mario and Luigi Fanclub Registration Project</h3>

                <p class="projectDescription">
                    In this project, I learned how to create a sign-in form using HTML for the basic set up and outline of the webpage and CSS to make the webpage look more fancy and appealing.
                    This project has helped me understand CSS and how to style a form and make it look appealing for the user. I later improved this project by adding form validation using JavaScript. 
                    I also applied some knowledge about web storage API using JavaScript in the latest update for this project. This project has helped me have a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I continuously made improvements to this project over time.
                    Here is the link to the project:
