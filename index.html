        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Fahad Arif - A student at Humber College and an aspiring Web Developer</p>

            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a student at Humber College, learning about web programming and javescript. My interests is gaming, reading, coding, and occasionally writing.</p>

            <p>In my journey so far, I have learned and gained experience and knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to apply them when coding. I continue to work on increasing my knowledge by working on personal projects or exercises to improve my skills and gain more experience.</p>
        <p>
            As I continue to grow, I will keep applying everything I learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will practice by doing exercises and use my knowledge, skills, and experience on bigger projects. Please feel free to explore my work.
