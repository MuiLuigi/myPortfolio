        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Fahad Arif - A student at Humber College and an aspiring Web Developer</p>

            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a student at Humber College, learning about web programming and javescript. My interests is gaming, reading, coding, and occasionally writing.</p>

            <p>In my journey so far, I have learned and gained experience and knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to apply them when coding. I continue to work on increasing my knowledge by working on personal projects or exercises to improve my skills and gain more experience.</p>
        <p>
            As I continue to grow, I will keep applying everything I learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will practice by doing exercises and use my knowledge, skills, and experience on bigger projects. Please feel free to explore my work.

                <p class="projectDescription">
                    In this project, I learned how to create a sign-in form using HTML for the basic set up and outline of the webpage and CSS to make the webpage look more fancy and appealing.
                    This project has helped me understand CSS and how to style a form and make it look appealing for the user. I later improved this project by adding form validation using JavaScript. 
                    I also applied some knowledge about web storage API using JavaScript in the latest update for this project. This project has helped me have a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I continuously made improvements to this project over time.

                <p class="projectDescription2">
                    This project is the first project I worked on using HTML. I learned the basics of HTML while working on this project. 
                    In this project, I learned how to add links, images, lists, and text to the webpage. This project taught me how to create an ordered list and tables as well. To create an ordered list, I used the ol tag. 
                    This is used for pretty much the general structure of the list. I learned to use the li tag, which means list items, to add the elements or content of the ordered list. To add a table to my website, I used the table tag. 
                    To create the table, I used the th tag to make the table headers. I used the tr tag to create the table rows. I used the td tag to create the data for the table. In the end, I used the "border" tag to create the lines or dividers for the table and to make the table look more cool and fancy.
                    This project has played an important role in helping me improve and learn more about web development.

                <h3>Mario and Luigi Blog Webpage Project</h3>
                <button class="description-btn3">Show Description</button>
                <p class="projectDescription3">
                    This project is my latest project for web development. In this project, I implemented everything I have learned so far for web development. 
                    In this project, I used HTML to create the basic structure of the webpage, like the buttons that allows the user to create a new blog or update/delete an existing blog. 
                    I used CSS to style the webpage and add some hover effects with the buttons that takes the user to the webpage where they could create new blogs or update/delete existing blogs.
                    I also used JavaScript to save the blog in the memory. I used eventListener for the system to know when the user clicks the submit button and show them a message that tells the user their blog has been saved successfully after filling in the required fields in the form.
                    I used the ".push()" function to add every new blog whenever the user creates a new blog and saves it into the memory. The user is able to select which blog they would like to edit or delete in the existing blogs webpage. Another major concept I learned while working on this project is working with GitHub and Git control.
                    I learned about creating new branches on GitHub and merging them to the main branch after commiting changes to all branches. Here is the link to the project:
